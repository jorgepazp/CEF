## What is this? 
COREAS stands for spanish 'Control y Registro de Asistencias', this is a program coded on Java 8 and its current state is  <b>unfinished</b>.
Basically, it lets you register and control (as the name says) assistance, by using an external <b>RFID Reader Module</b>, connected by an Arduino board.
Its main purpose was to fulfill an assignment on the topic of <b>Software Engineering</b>.
It was intended for the use of a managerial user in the need of administrate their workers (forestal firefighters in the assignment's case)

## What libraries did you use?
https://github.com/PanamaHitek/PanamaHitek_Arduino <br>
PostgresSQL JDBC (latest version)

## What can it do?
The goal was to make a tool with basic CRUD functions on a modern interface; unfortunately I had to remove some of the initial functions on the deadline.
By now, the current available tools are:<br>
- Add an office or Headquarters<br>
- Add workers to an office or HQ<br>
- Modify workers trivial data (Such as e-mail, nationality and others..)<br>
- Delete workers (not from the database)
- Register assistance of the workers ( this was done by connecting a RFID module to an Arduino, which tells the program who has just checked in or out)

## Are you going to continue with this proyect?
I hope so, honestly I had lots of fun doing this (as headaches aswell) and i would love to continue with this and hopefully end it. But by now I'm on some other projects 
so at the moment I can only help you with the current version of this.. If you ever going to use this to work with an RFID or Arduino with Java and need some help,
write me to my e-mail address.
